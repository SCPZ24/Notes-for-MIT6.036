# Concepts
## Sample Space $\Omega$
Set of possible outcomes of a random experience.
Exhaustive: every element shall have a respective possibility value.
Elements can be shown on Venn Images.
## Event
Subset of Sample Space.
## Discrete/Continuous Examples
Discrete: $\Omega$ has finite elements
Continuous: $\Omega$ has infinite elements, P(each element) = 0
## Rules
$P(A) \geq 0$
$p(\Omega) = 1$
If $A_1,A_2......$are disjoint events, then:$P(A_1\bigcup A_2\bigcup A_3......)=P(A_1)+P(A_2)+P(A_3)+......$
$P(A\bigcup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\bigcap B)$

# Independence
## To say A & B is independent: 
$P(A\bigcap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)$
## Multiple Independent

## Pairwise Independence
If in each pair of events such that the two events are independent to each other, we say the model is Pairwise Independent.
However, Pairwise Independence ≠ Independence.
For example:
	if $P(A\bigcap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B),P(B\bigcap C)=P(B)\cdot P(C),P(A\bigcap C)=P(A)\cdot P(C)$，we can't have $P(A\bigcap B\bigcap C)=P(A)\cdot P(B)\cdot P(C)$
